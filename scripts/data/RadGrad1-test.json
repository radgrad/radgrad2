This certificate can be obtained in 18 months after graduation, and you can take classes in the evening or online. \n\nYou don't have to wait until you obtain a teaching certificate to get started teaching. Consider programs such as [Teach for America](https://hawaii.teachforamerica.org/teaching-here). In addition, many private schools in Hawaii do not require a teaching certificate.
