But obtaining an M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science at some point can open up many new opportunities in your professional career. \n\nThe basic difference between an M.S. and Ph.D. degree is \"scientific contribution\".  An M.S. degree enables you to obtain more advanced skills in any of the CS disciplines.  M.S. programs are typically two years long.  A Ph.D. degree adds the requirement that you develop a dissertation that documents a scientific contribution: some entirely new knowledge about computer science. The Ph.D. degree typically requires at least two to four additional years after the M.S. degree.  \n\nTo prepare to include graduate school at some point after you graduate, the most important thing to do is to plan one or more semesters where you participate in a research project with a professor.  You can do this via [ICS 499](/explorer/courses/ics_499), or even on a volunteer basis as long as you devote sufficient time to the project. This is important for two reasons. First, successful participation demonstrates to the people who later review your graduate school application that you are able to do graduate-level work, which is usually more independent and research-related.  Second, it enables your professor to get to know you on a more personal level and in the context of an independent project, not just a few homework assignments.  This will enable your professor to write you a strong recommendation letter, which is crucial to getting accepted to graduate school. \n\nFor more information, you might want to read [\"So you want to apply to grad school?\"](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/so-you-want-to-apply-to-/explorer/career-goals/graduate-school/)",

The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input. \n\nLearn more [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)",

Most people have their first exposure to Jupyter Notebook by way of a data visualization, a shared notebook that includes a rendering of some data set as a graphic. Jupyter Notebook lets you author visualizations, but also share them and allow interactive changes to the shared code and data set.\n\n  * Code sharing. Cloud services like GitHub and Pastebin provide ways to share code, but they’re largely non-interactive. With a Jupyter Notebook, you can view code, execute it, and display the results directly in your web browser.\n\n  * Live interactions with code. Jupyter Notebook code isn’t static; it can be edited and re-run incrementally in real time, with feedback provided directly in the browser. Notebooks can also embed user controls (e.g., sliders or text input fields) that can be used as input sources for code.\n\n  * Documenting code samples. If you have a piece of code and you want to explain line-by-line how it works, with live feedback all along the way, you could embed it in a Jupyter Notebook. Best of all, the code will remain fully functional—you can add interactivity along with the explanation, showing and telling at the same time.\n\nFor more information, see [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)",

To date, such capability has only been used for limited purposes, including contact tracing and the exchange of pictures.\n\nThe AllNet project aims to support general interpersonal communications directly between devices, even in the absence of cellular or Internet service.\n\nWe are looking for students who want to learn how to get different devices, both computers and cellphones/mobiles, to talk directly with each other. We are also interested in students who think they can adapt the current code to run as an app on their favorite mobile device.\n\nHere are some current projects we are working on:\n\n*AllNet Apps:* The xchat peer-to-peer app for allnet has been developed for iOS, and a preliminary implementation exists for Android. More work needs to be done on both, but especially the Android app must be brought up to date and given more complete functionality.\n\n*A portable peer-to-peer library:* AllNet is designed to work both with the regular network infrastructure -- wired, cellular, and WiFi links -- and without it, using peer-to-peer (p2p) communications.  Some of the p2p has been implemented, specifically wifi ad-hoc mode between Linux systems and multipeer connectivity between apple system.  More work needs to be done to include Android and Windows systems and to provide cross-platform connectivity.\n\nTo apply:  Send email to esb@hawaii.edu.  Please include a brief description of what you hope to get out of the internship, what skills you might bring to the project, and how much time you are likely to be able to commit to it.\n\nLearn more at: [http://alnt.org/](http://alnt.org/).",

However, such large memory comes at the cost of slow access, compared to the speed of individual cores. To hide the latency of access to slow RAM, modern multicore processors come with faster, but much smaller caches. Thus, for optimal performance, it is very important to intelligently utilize these limited faster caches.\n\nIn this project we develop and implement new parallel algorithms which efficiently utilize available caches. We also study the limits of parallel computation in the presence of caches. Knowledge of parallel programming is a plus, but is NOT a prerequisite to start working on this project.\n\nRelevant courses: ICS 311, ICS 432, ICS 443, ICS 621, ICS 643, ICS 691C.\n\nThis project is sponsored by the [AlgoPARC](http://algoparc.ics.hawaii.edu/) research group, and there is REU funding so there is the possibility of being paid for your work.",

And yes, many  scientific applications  need to perform large amounts of  computation as quickly  as possible. A well-known challenge is thus of orchestrate  application executions and to configure hardware platforms in a way that  strikes good compromises between achieved performance and energy  consumption.  \n\nOne particularly important class of scientific  applications are scientific workflows, which consist of large numbers of computational  tasks with inter-task dependencies. Several  algorithms  have been developed  to  make the execution of these  applications  \"energy-aware\". These  algorithms make their decisions based on models of the  energy consumption of workflow tasks. The  models  traditionally used have often naive and inaccurate.  Prof. Casanova and his collaborators have recently proposed a new model that has been shown to be more accurate ([see this ICCS'19 paper](https://henricasanova.github.io/files/papers/da_silva_iccs2019.pdf)). The next step is to quantify to  (beneficial) impact of using this model when executing workflow applications.\n\nThis is a research position in which one learns about the key concepts under high-performance computing, implements known algorithms as part of an existing  (but to be extended)  simulator written in C++, run simulation experiments, and draws conclusions. The intention  is to work in close collaboration  with professors and graduate students already working in this area. This internship would be well-balanced in terms of information finding, software development, and experimental analysis.  A research paper should  come out of it, on which the intern would be an author (and likely a first author) if the internship is successful).\n\nApply by e-mailing Prof. Casanova at henric@hawaii.edu mentioning \"Research internship\"",

WRENCH is  an open-source C++ framework to aid in the development of simulators of distributed computing systems. Version 1.6 of the software is planned to be released in early  May 2020. WRENCH developers employ standard software engineering practices and tools (github, continuous integration with Travis and Docker, testing with Google Test, code coverage with Codecov, code quality measures with  Codacy, and many more).  \n\nThis project, although  not very  large yet (10,000 lines of C++ code) is relatively complex. Because of the typical drive-to-publish-result constraint, although the code is reasonably well-implemented  (and very well documents), it could be vastly improved in terms of code re-use, modularity, C++-ness, templating, development of examples, high-level documentation, code coverage, etc.  Because this is a research project (funded by the NSF), the project participants are constantly pushing the research agenda and cannot invest too much time in the software itself (they still do  too much of it, which is why the code is as good as it is, but not enough). \n\nMore details are available at: [https://wrench-project.org/](https://wrench-project.org/).\n\n\nThis is a pure development situation in which the student would come in as a \"C++ ninja\" and would make series of suggestions, improvements, and contributions to the source code. An applicant that already has great C++ chops would be ideal, but a motivated applicant that would see this as an opportunity to gain great C++ chops will of course be considered. It is also expected that the student would learn about WRENCH and what it is used for, contribute to ongoing WRENCH development efforts, and also contribute to various projects that are currently developing extensions to WRENCH and/or simulators that use WRENCH.\n\nApply by e-mailing Prof. Casanova at henric@hawaii.edu mentioning \"Wrench Project\"",

Compared to all the courses I've taken before, this has to be the most time consuming. It's not that the concepts are difficult to understand nor is the courseload that heavy, but I found myself having to put more time to review and understand everything. The class structure for this was inverted, so we watched video lectures in our own time and used class time to do actual problems. I thought it was a better use of class time.",

The projects weren't hard for beginner programmers and were interesting to get them to have more fun with programming. The only downside was that the class didn't fully prepare you for ICS 211 where the fun little projects became assignments focused on the next stage of programming. There isn't much new students can do in terms of preparing for ICS 211 from ICS 111 since it is based on what you learn, but the things that you do learn may prove useful.",

This is a great language to learn since it is the most common programming language used to manipulate or manage a database.  Knowing SQL can be a useful skill since it is sought after by employers in positions and fields that are not strictly ICS related.  For example, any business that uses a database to function requires it, including retailers, hospitals, banks, et cetera. With that said, I highly recommend taking this course to learn this invaluable language. One nice thing about taking this course is that the professor records his in-class lectures.  Bear in mind that the purpose of this is not to encourage students to get lazy and not attend his class.  I would not recommend this since there are times when his recordings do not cover solutions that he explains exclusively to those who attend his class.  Instead, the advantage of having these recordings available will allow one to rewatch the lecture in case he or she gets stuck and has a \\\"How do I do this again?\\\" moment.",

The assignments are very interesting because you get to mess around with a program that allows you to make and manipulate a virtual circuit. The downside is unless you plan on working with low level language code, the material you learn in this class may be irrelevant to what you will do in the future. That being said, I did enjoy the class and the assignments, and I advise that you should take the time to learn about binary and hex coding anyway.",

As others have mentioned, this hackathon differs in the way that it offers participants an entire month to flesh out their ideas and develop their apps, so judges really do expect a lot more and have higher standards when evaluating our final submissions. I would recommend everyone to participate in this challenge to get the feel of competing in a hackathon without the pressure to finish in only a few days. It’s also a great opportunity to go outside of your comfort zone to find the best solution for your challenge, even if it’s not a language or framework that you’re intimately familiar with. My favorite part of this event is seeing all the amazing apps that teams have developed at the end of the month. It’s extremely inspiring and motivating to see everyone’s finished product and encourages me to start my own side projects.",
