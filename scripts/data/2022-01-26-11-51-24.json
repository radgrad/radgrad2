But obtaining an M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science at some point can open up many new opportunities in your professional career. \n\nThe basic difference between an M.S. and Ph.D. degree is \"scientific contribution\".  An M.S. degree enables you to obtain more advanced skills in any of the CS disciplines.  M.S. programs are typically two years long.  A Ph.D. degree adds the requirement that you develop a dissertation that documents a scientific contribution: some entirely new knowledge about computer science. The Ph.D. degree typically requires at least two to four additional years after the M.S. degree.  \n\nTo prepare to include graduate school at some point after you graduate, the most important thing to do is to plan one or more semesters where you participate in a research project with a professor.  You can do this via [ICS 499](/explorer/courses/ics_499), or even on a volunteer basis as long as you devote sufficient time to the project. This is important for two reasons. First, successful participation demonstrates to the people who later review your graduate school application that you are able to do graduate-level work, which is usually more independent and research-related.  Second, it enables your professor to get to know you on a more personal level and in the context of an independent project, not just a few homework assignments.  This will enable your professor to write you a strong recommendation letter, which is crucial to getting accepted to graduate school. \n\nFor more information, you might want to read [\"So you want to apply to grad school?\"](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/so-you-want-to-apply-to-/explorer/career-goals/graduate-school/)",

Usually you start with something you’d like to improve. Say you love fish and have a home or school aquarium. Since you’ve got some really fancy fish, they need the water temperature to stay between 20 and 30 degrees Centigrade. You could always check the water temperature, but it would be better if you had a microcontroller to help you out! You could start with a simple temperature manager, but even better would be one that could email or text you to let you know if something went amiss and maybe the heater broke. That’s what the Internet of Things is all about: Making stuff smart!\"\n\nLimor \"Ladyada\" Fried is the founder and CEO of Adafruit Industries, an open-source hardware company.

Most people have their first exposure to Jupyter Notebook by way of a data visualization, a shared notebook that includes a rendering of some data set as a graphic. Jupyter Notebook lets you author visualizations, but also share them and allow interactive changes to the shared code and data set.\n\n  * Code sharing. Cloud services like GitHub and Pastebin provide ways to share code, but they’re largely non-interactive. With a Jupyter Notebook, you can view code, execute it, and display the results directly in your web browser.\n\n  * Live interactions with code. Jupyter Notebook code isn’t static; it can be edited and re-run incrementally in real time, with feedback provided directly in the browser. Notebooks can also embed user controls (e.g., sliders or text input fields) that can be used as input sources for code.\n\n  * Documenting code samples. If you have a piece of code and you want to explain line-by-line how it works, with live feedback all along the way, you could embed it in a Jupyter Notebook. Best of all, the code will remain fully functional—you can add interactivity along with the explanation, showing and telling at the same time.\n\nFor more information, see [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)",

If you’ve ever wanted to found your own company, or just get experience of scale at this unique stage - this is the role for you.\n\nIn this role you will do many things that might be familiar as a Principal, Full-Stack, or another type of Engineer. What’s different about a Founding Engineer is you’re first building a company and a culture. And the customer and product follows that.\n\nWhat we really want in a Founding Engineer is someone who wants build something great from the ground up. More importantly, someone that wants to share the experience with a great team.\nWho are we?\nOur mission is to create calmer organizations. With Pyn, employees get more of the messages they need, and fewer of the ones they don’t. We do this by providing companies with tools for targeted, tailored communications.\n\nOur founders are Jon Williams and Joris Luijke. Jon previously co-founded the technology company Culture Amp. Joris helped scale the culture of Atlassian and Squarespace as their Head of People. Pyn is backed by Accel; an early investor in Facebook, Slack, Dropbox, and many more great companies.\n\nPyn originates from Sydney, Australia. However, we have employees and customers across the globe. While we work remotely, we still love to get together if and when we can. Ideally our employees have good overlap with the Australian Eastern or Pacific time zones.\nYour impact\nAs Founding Engineer, you will champion new features all the way from ideation to implementation. As this champion, you will be talking to our customers every day.\n\nAt Pyn, you will work across the whole organization. Everything from building our Web Application, to helping customers, mentoring engineers, and building our culture.\n\nIn terms of nuts and bolts: The Pyn Application uses React and GraphQL. The codebase is largely TypeScript and deployed on a serverless AWS infrastructure.\n\nWe expect this architecture to evolve considerably as we grow. As a Founding Engineer, you’ll be responsible for technical direction in this evolution. You will be a key part of Pyn shipping fast, scaling up, and staying secure for our customers.\nWhat we offer\nAt Pyn you will:\n\n\nwork directly with the Founders on product direction, strategy, and execution.\nbe part of forming our values, and a leader for the culture we are building.\nwork with Jon and the team on the software architecture and strategy.\nhave regular, direct contact with our customers to understand their needs.\nuse your experience to mentor and grow other team members.\n* be in a dynamic remote-work environment, with flexible hours and parental leave.\nexercise your curiosity and grow technical, product, and people skills.\ncontinue to ship code daily (if not hourly!) to get value to customers hands as soon as possible.\n\n\n… change the way companies communicate with their employees.\nWhat you bring\nWe recognize that people and careers are a unique journey. Recognizing this, we do not have strict skill and education requirements. Whilst there will always be specific skills we see as useful, we value the whole of what you can bring to Pyn.\n\nAs one of our most senior hires, we want to draw upon your experience. As such it’s likely you’re a number of years into your career (or careers!). Whilst a traditional engineering background will suit this, so will many others.\n\nWe’re striving to create a diverse environment and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. If you’re curious and passionate about improving employee communications, then we’d love to hear from you.",

We are experienced moonshot prototypers and have exhibited design work internationally at top venues. Our board has professors from the top robotics schools in the world and experienced founders in the area.\n\nWe are looking for energetic folks to join our team who are excited to create technology that transforms the world at scale. \n👀 The Opportunity\nEver wonder why we pay a premium for sushi?\n\nWhy confined, farmed fish are the standard in supermarkets?\n\nHow large legacy industries operationally tick?\n\nShinkei is looking for mechanical engineers for a paid opportunity over the summer to work on transforming society’s relationship with an animal that feeds billions of mouths annually. We’re on the lookout for people who love to get their hands dirty building working prototypes for moonshot ideas and who can take responsibility meeting deadlines over extended project timelines.\n\nYou won't be limited to clinking metal — we believe engineers should be involved in company strategy, product direction, and anything else you might be interested in.\nWhat You Get To Do:\n\nDesign real robotics solutions to solve major humanitarian concerns\nUtilize mechanical engineering tools by building a product end-to-end\nWork autonomously in a fast-paced entrepreneurial environment from either New York or Philadelphia\nUnrestricted access to a makerspace\nTalk to real customers for user research on design\nSet the foundation for our engineering culture\nTravel to Maryland to try out traditional techniques aboard industrial boats\nHave a hand in transforming our relationship with our food\n\nWhat You Need:\n\nAn innovative mind with a practical bend and an interest in changing the way we consume our food\nPursuing bachelors or masters in Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, similar field or sufficient previous experience\nBackground (portfolio, side projects, coursework) in physical prototyping, gantry design and misc. mechanical engineering projects\nBasic abilities with mechanical design tools (SolidWorks, FEA, drawings and documentation)\nCapable of researching, designing and testing using rapid prototyping techniques\nExperience with lab testing and fabrication equipment\nFamiliarity with common manufacturing processes a plus\nExposure and interest to robotics or embedded systems a strong plus",

Learn about the inner workings of a fast-growing hardware startup with a breakout product in the heart of Silicon Valley. Enjoy the satisfaction of writing code that ends up in customers’ hands. Spend time at construction sites where our robot is printing layouts to evaluate your contributions in action.\n\nOur engineering team designs and builds our mobile printing robot, the software that runs the robot, the user interfaces that help workers operate the robot, and customer-facing portals that are driving fundamental change in the process of constructing buildings. As an intern, you could work on any area of our product, depending on your background:\n\n\nSoftware Engineering (C++, Python, iOS, React / full-stack web development)\nRobotics\nControl Systems\nData Science\nMechanical Engineering\nElectrical Engineering\nMechatronics\nUX design\n\n\nIf you span more than one of these areas, even better! We love generalists who are always ready to spring from one set of skills to another.\n\nWe like to give interns projects that combine getting a specific piece of work done with an open question to explore for further refinement. For example, you might integrate a new sensor on the robot, then collect data to evaluate its performance. Or, you might implement a specific feature in the operator interface, then head out to a construction site to see how useful it is to operators. You’ll experience this fundamental cycle of product development for yourself.\n\nWorking at Dusty\n\nWe are a culture of do-ers who respect each others’ strengths, and work together to accomplish the impossible. We value open-mindedness, technical depth, passion for what we’re building, an itch to build something with your own two hands. We celebrate people who create their own narratives rather than living someone else’s.\n\nWe also provide mentorship in all areas of engineering to help you do your best work. In addition to day-to-day guidance from experienced engineers, we host weekly discussions on engineering topics. We reimburse attendance fees for technology conferences on robotics and other fields. And we offer support in accessing whatever resources you find helpful.\n\nSpending your internship in Silicon Valley also offers tremendous opportunities to learn from the concentration of innovative people who work and live here! You’ll find conferences, meetups, presentations and informal get-togethers related to pretty much any area of technology or the tech industry that interests you. Dusty is located in the heart of it all.",

          "description": "*Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis and this posting could close before the deadline.\n\nARS Office/Lab and Location: A postdoctoral research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit located in Hilo, Hawaii.\n\nThe Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: The project will focus on the chemical ecology of Oriental fruit fly (OFF), Bactrocera dorsalis, one of the most destructive invasive pests of tropical crops worldwide. Current OFF quarantine programs focus on the surveillance and control of male flies. However, the male-oriented strategy is less effective for mitigating the impact caused by female populations, which could lead to fruit damage and ensuing trade issues. The primary goal of the project is to develop novel female attractants that can target different physiological status of female flies. The participant will join a multidisciplinary team of researchers and collaborate on (1) behavioral testing of volatiles emitted from microbes, host plants and protein food, (2) identification of key attractant volatiles using GC-EAD and GC-MS, and (3) field testing of developed lures and baits.\n\nLearning Objectives: The participant will be encouraged to develop independent and collaborative research, publish research results, and promote technology transfer through conference attendance, presentations and Cooperative Research And Development Agreements with commercial companies.\n\nMentor(s): The mentors for this opportunity are Dong Cha (dong.cha@usda.gov) and Paul Kendra (paul.kendra@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: January 2022.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full-time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\nQuestions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email USDA-ARS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.",

Whether you are a new writer looking to launch your career and build your portfolio or you are an experienced writer looking to break into a new field and improve your skills (while helping animals in the process), there is a spot for you at Furzly! You will be working on our sister companies' website Preferable Pups.\n\nWho We Are: \n\nWe’re on a mission to help pets around the world! With our sights set on becoming the most authoritative pet platform available, Furzly leads the conversation about pet health and information while still producing media that reminds us how much of a treasure animals are. How? We do this by empowering our writing community to create valuable, insightful content that can be leveraged on a global scale. Our success is dependent on having a community of writers that create stories for our educational platform.\n\nThat’s where you come in!\n\nWho We Are Looking For: \n\nWe understand that internships these days can be difficult to land, and the unfortunate truth about building a writing career is that you need a starting point to prove your worth and build your skillset. Fortunately, we are here to help! Here are the types of people we are looking to add to our Furzly team:\n\nYou Have a Passion for Pets: Since we are a pet site, this is a must! Our furry friends are our passion and they should be yours as well!\nYou Are Upbeat and Positive: Negative attitudes make for poor workplace environments (even in remote positions!). We want everyone on our team to have a great attitude when they approach their work and speak with other members of the team. If your tail is not wagging, we are not having it!\nYou Are Motivated to Make Every Article Your Best: There are writers who approach writing like work and there are writers who approach writing with the intent to provide their readers with value. You want every piece to be your best, and you want to make sure that it is the most authoritative on the web. You get out what you put in!\nYou Are Organized and Can Work With Our Editorial Team: We all have late days and messy desks, but we want you to be an individual who is highly-organized and who loves keeping track of their tasks from start to finish. This helps us get through our content strategy and provide you with the content that you want to write!\nYou Are Ambitious and Want to Change the World: You ask questions. You look for the details that others miss. You write copy that is compelling. Put simply, you are a go-getter who is looking to do the most!\nYou Are Communicative: You are always easy to connect with and have no problems asking questions to other team members. Although we are a remote team, we want people who are there when we need them and who are highly involved in the project!What We Expect From You: \n\nIf you are the person we described above, that’s awesome! Now that we have you here, let’s talk about some of the expectations that we will have for you in this internship position.\n\nYou Are Available to Write (Ideally) Two Blog Posts Per Day: We don’t ask for much, but we do want you to be available to write (ideally) two blog posts per day. If you feel like you can do more, that’s great! However, this will be the sweet spot for us as we grow.\nYou Are Active on Your Phone or Computer Throughout the Day: We have to be able to contact you in case we have any questions for you or you have any questions for us. We usually communicate through Slack but will sometimes send emails or chat on the phone.\nYou Can Follow Directions (But Are Not Afraid to Pitch): Being able to adhere to our writer’s guidelines and match our tone is a must, but we also want you to have fun with your copy! In addition, we are always open to pitches. If you have ideas that you think would be great for the website, you are not afraid to pitch it to us!\nYou May Produce a Variety of Content (Deep Research, Viral Content, News Stories): Based on your initial trial article, we will assign you the content that we believe best matches your tone and experience. However, we do value those who feel brave enough to step outside of their comfort zone and tackle new projects. What You Can Expect to Gain From Working at Furzly: \n\nAs we explained above, launching a writing career and gaining new skills is the toughest part of being a writer. While we want you to succeed here at Furzly, we also want you to succeed in your personal life. So, what can you expect Furzly to do for you?\n\nWe Give You Full Credit for Your Work: That’s right! Everything that you publish on our website features your name and internship status. If you are looking to attract potential employers, your status and published works are sure to do it!\nYou Get a Portfolio on Our Website: Better yet, we provide you with an online portfolio that gives you an opportunity to showcase your work, wrapped with a bow made of a photo of yourself and a nice byline to boot.\nYou Gain Valuable Insight Into the Writing and Editorial Process– Working on publications requires you to understand how to pitch your ideas, successfully develop your content, and establish relationships with others on your team, whether they are editorial staff or fellow writers. Here at Furzly, you gain valuable insight into the writing and editorial process that you can apply towards future positions!\nWe, Will, Be Adding Extra Incentives As We Grow: Once we build a solid content base, we will begin adding extra goodies like gift cards, pet bonuses, and other incentives that you can leverage your content skills to earn!\n\nYou will be working with our sister company, Preferable Pups, and your role will consist of\n\nEmailing dog breeders\nWriting Top 5 Dog Breeder Posts Example:https://preferablepups.com/4-best-miniature-dachshund-breeders-in-louisiana/\nCommunicating with the dog breeders to have a \"Badge\" installed on their website. We will assist you in this process.\nWriting a 500-word article that will go on the breeder's website with a backlink to Preferable Pups.\n\nIf we still have you here and you’re interested in working with us, please reply to this post with your relevant work experience (if any), why you want to work with us, and what your favorite breed of dog or cat is.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you!'",

To date, such capability has only been used for limited purposes, including contact tracing and the exchange of pictures.\n\nThe AllNet project aims to support general interpersonal communications directly between devices, even in the absence of cellular or Internet service.\n\nWe are looking for students who want to learn how to get different devices, both computers and cellphones/mobiles, to talk directly with each other. We are also interested in students who think they can adapt the current code to run as an app on their favorite mobile device.\n\nHere are some current projects we are working on:\n\n*AllNet Apps:* The xchat peer-to-peer app for allnet has been developed for iOS, and a preliminary implementation exists for Android. More work needs to be done on both, but especially the Android app must be brought up to date and given more complete functionality.\n\n*A portable peer-to-peer library:* AllNet is designed to work both with the regular network infrastructure -- wired, cellular, and WiFi links -- and without it, using peer-to-peer (p2p) communications.  Some of the p2p has been implemented, specifically wifi ad-hoc mode between Linux systems and multipeer connectivity between apple system.  More work needs to be done to include Android and Windows systems and to provide cross-platform connectivity.\n\nTo apply:  Send email to esb@hawaii.edu.

However, such large memory comes at the cost of slow access, compared to the speed of individual cores. To hide the latency of access to slow RAM, modern multicore processors come with faster, but much smaller caches. Thus, for optimal performance, it is very important to intelligently utilize these limited faster caches.\n\nIn this project we develop and implement new parallel algorithms which efficiently utilize available caches. We also study the limits of parallel computation in the presence of caches. Knowledge of parallel programming is a plus, but is NOT a prerequisite to start working on this project.\n\nRelevant courses: ICS 311, ICS 432, ICS 443, ICS 621, ICS 643, ICS 691C.\n\nThis project is sponsored by the [AlgoPARC](http://algoparc.ics.hawaii.edu/) research group, and there is REU funding so there is the possibility of being paid for your work.",

And yes, many  scientific applications  need to perform large amounts of  computation as quickly  as possible. A well-known challenge is thus of orchestrate  application executions and to configure hardware platforms in a way that  strikes good compromises between achieved performance and energy  consumption.  \n\nOne particularly important class of scientific  applications are scientific workflows, which consist of large numbers of computational  tasks with inter-task dependencies. Several  algorithms  have been developed  to  make the execution of these  applications  \"energy-aware\". These  algorithms make their decisions based on models of the  energy consumption of workflow tasks. The  models  traditionally used have often naive and inaccurate.  Prof. Casanova and his collaborators have recently proposed a new model that has been shown to be more accurate ([see this ICCS'19 paper](https://henricasanova.github.io/files/papers/da_silva_iccs2019.pdf)). The next step is to quantify to  (beneficial) impact of using this model when executing workflow applications.\n\nThis is a research position in which one learns about the key concepts under high-performance computing, implements known algorithms as part of an existing  (but to be extended)  simulator written in C++, run simulation experiments, and draws conclusions. The intention  is to work in close collaboration  with professors and graduate students already working in this area. This internship would be well-balanced in terms of information finding, software development, and experimental analysis.  A research paper should  come out of it, on which the intern would be an author (and likely a first author) if the internship is successful).\n\nApply by e-mailing Prof. Casanova at henric@hawaii.edu mentioning \"Research internship\"",

WRENCH is  an open-source C++ framework to aid in the development of simulators of distributed computing systems. Version 1.6 of the software is planned to be released in early  May 2020. WRENCH developers employ standard software engineering practices and tools (github, continuous integration with Travis and Docker, testing with Google Test, code coverage with Codecov, code quality measures with  Codacy, and many more).  \n\nThis project, although  not very  large yet (10,000 lines of C++ code) is relatively complex. Because of the typical drive-to-publish-result constraint, although the code is reasonably well-implemented  (and very well documents), it could be vastly improved in terms of code re-use, modularity, C++-ness, templating, development of examples, high-level documentation, code coverage, etc.  Because this is a research project (funded by the NSF), the project participants are constantly pushing the research agenda and cannot invest too much time in the software itself (they still do  too much of it, which is why the code is as good as it is, but not enough). \n\nMore details are available at: [https://wrench-project.org/](https://wrench-project.org/).\n\n\nThis is a pure development situation in which the student would come in as a \"C++ ninja\" and would make series of suggestions, improvements, and contributions to the source code. An applicant that already has great C++ chops would be ideal, but a motivated applicant that would see this as an opportunity to gain great C++ chops will of course be considered. It is also expected that the student would learn about WRENCH and what it is used for, contribute to ongoing WRENCH development efforts, and also contribute to various projects that are currently developing extensions to WRENCH and/or simulators that use WRENCH.\n\nApply by e-mailing Prof. Casanova at henric@hawaii.edu mentioning \"Wrench Project\"",

Compared to all the courses I've taken before, this has to be the most time consuming. It's not that the concepts are difficult to understand nor is the courseload that heavy, but I found myself having to put more time to review and understand everything. The class structure for this was inverted, so we watched video lectures in our own time and used class time to do actual problems. I thought it was a better use of class time.",

The projects weren't hard for beginner programmers and were interesting to get them to have more fun with programming. The only downside was that the class didn't fully prepare you for ICS 211 where the fun little projects became assignments focused on the next stage of programming. There isn't much new students can do in terms of preparing for ICS 211 from ICS 111 since it is based on what you learn, but the things that you do learn may prove useful.",

This is a great language to learn since it is the most common programming language used to manipulate or manage a database.  Knowing SQL can be a useful skill since it is sought after by employers in positions and fields that are not strictly ICS related.  For example, any business that uses a database to function requires it, including retailers, hospitals, banks, et cetera. With that said, I highly recommend taking this course to learn this invaluable language. One nice thing about taking this course is that the professor records his in-class lectures.  Bear in mind that the purpose of this is not to encourage students to get lazy and not attend his class.  I would not recommend this since there are times when his recordings do not cover solutions that he explains exclusively to those who attend his class.  Instead, the advantage of having these recordings available will allow one to rewatch the lecture in case he or she gets stuck and has a \\\"How do I do this again?\\\" moment.",

The downside is unless you plan on working with low level language code, the material you learn in this class may be irrelevant to what you will do in the future.

I would recommend everyone to participate in this challenge to get the feel of competing in a hackathon without the pressure to finish in only a few days. It’s also a great opportunity to go outside of your comfort zone to find the best solution for your challenge, even if it’s not a language or framework that you’re intimately familiar with. My favorite part of this event is seeing all the amazing apps that teams have developed at the end of the month. It’s extremely inspiring and motivating to see everyone’s finished product and encourages me to start my own side projects.",
