## Terms and Conditions

Thank you for your interest in joining the RadGrad community! Here are the terms and conditions associated with your participation.

### You agree to adhere to the UHM Code of Conduct

As a student, faculty, or advisor, use of RadGrad means you will avoid "proscribed conduct" as specified at [http://www.studentaffairs.manoa.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct_code/#IV](http://www.studentaffairs.manoa.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct_code/#IV). This includes but is not limited to:

  * Acts of dishonesty
  * Disruption or obstruction of teaching or research
  * Threatening health and safety, including physical abuse, verbal abuse, intimidation, harassment, bullying
  * Sex discrimination or gender-based violence.

### You agree to reveal your name and email address within the community

An important part of the RadGrad experience is the creation of a "community of practice": students, faculty, and advisors who work together on topics of common interest.

For RadGrad to create a community of practice, you must agree to allow the system to reveal your name and email address to others.

There are other aspects of your RadGrad profile that you can optionally reveal if you wish. Go to your Visibility page to adjust what others can see about you.
