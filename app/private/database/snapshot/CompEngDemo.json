This doesn't mean you need to go right back to school after you graduate; many if not most graduate students in computer engineering spent at least a few years working before returning to school. But obtaining an M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science at some point can open up many new opportunities in your professional career. \n\nThe basic difference between an M.S. and Ph.D. degree is \"scientific contribution\".  An M.S. degree enables you to obtain more advanced skills in any of the CS disciplines.  M.S. programs are typically two years long.  A Ph.D. degree adds the requirement that you develop a dissertation that documents a scientific contribution: some entirely new knowledge about computer engineering. The Ph.D. degree typically requires at least two to four additional years after the M.S. degree.  \n\nTo prepare to include graduate school at some point after you graduate, the most important thing to do is to plan one or more academicTerms where you participate in a research project with a professor.  You can do this via [ICS 499](/explorer/courses/ics_499), or even on a volunteer basis as long as you devote sufficient time to the project. This is important for two reasons. First, successful participation demonstrates to the people who later review your graduate school application that you are able to do graduate-level work, which is usually more independent and research-related.  Second, it enables your professor to get to know you on a more personal level and in the context of an independent project, not just a few homework assignments.  This will enable your professor to write you a strong recommendation letter, which is crucial to getting accepted to graduate school.

You'll also want to take Design for Mobile Devices ([ICS 466](/explorer/courses/ics_466)).  \n\nIn addition to coursework, you'll want to develop specialized skills for your platform of choice: Android development involves a variant of Java, while modern iOS development involves the Swift programming language. You might want to take a summer course through Udacity or Coursera to augment your ICS preparation.\n\nFinally, if you want a career in mobile application development, don't wait to get started!   There's nothing preventing you from building a few applications and releasing them in the Android or iOS app stores.

Research scientists have the highest level of autonomy of any career goal; you are hired by an organization with the expectation that you will define and organize your work yourself (while within the general business or academic constraints of the organization).  Research scientists can often wear jeans and a t-shirt to work, because you will be evaluated almost totally on your ability to innovate. \n\nTo prepare to become a research scientist, you should also have [graduate school](/explorer/career-goals/graduate-school) as a career goal, and you should plan to (eventually) get a Ph.D. That said, you don't have to go to graduate school immediately: you might decide after graduation to first join or create a startup company based upon an idea you had as an undergraduate.  Successful research scientists have a tolerance for risk: not all research ideas are successful (if you can guarantee in advance that an idea will be successful, then by definition it no longer involves research).\n\nIf this career goal appeals to you, get involved with one (or more) research projects as an undergraduate.  This will both give you a taste for the work and enable you to develop connections with professors that will help when you eventually apply to graduate school.  If possible, try to publish a paper while you are an undergraduate. Your professor can help you to make that happen.

Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.

With a Jupyter Notebook, you can view code, execute it, and display the results directly in your web browser.\n\n  * Live interactions with code. Jupyter Notebook code isn’t static; it can be edited and re-run incrementally in real time, with feedback provided directly in the browser. Notebooks can also embed user controls (e.g., sliders or text input fields) that can be used as input sources for code.\n\n  * Documenting code samples. If you have a piece of code and you want to explain line-by-line how it works, with live feedback all along the way, you could embed it in a Jupyter Notebook. Best of all, the code will remain fully functional—you can add interactivity along with the explanation, showing and telling at the same time.\n\nFor more information, see [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)",

In some cases parallelism is transparent to the programmer, such as in bit-level or instruction-level parallelism, but explicitly parallel algorithms, particularly those that use concurrency, are more difficult to write than sequential ones, because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions are the most common. Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting good parallel program performance.

They are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. \n\nLarge-scale quantum computers would theoretically be able to solve certain problems much more quickly than any classical computers that use even the best currently known algorithms, like integer factorization using Shor's algorithm (which is a quantum algorithm) and the simulation of quantum many-body systems. There exist quantum algorithms, such as Simon's algorithm, that run faster than any possible probabilistic classical algorithm.\n\nFor more information on Quantum Computing, you can start with the [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing).

VIP programs at each institution seek to foster long-term, in-depth, project-based learning to engage students and better prepare them for future careers. VIP teams are vertically integrated: they consist of a faculty mentor, graduate student researchers, and undergraduates of all levels. The teams are large (10 to 20 undergraduates each semester), the projects are long-term (at least 5 years in scope), and are based on an externally funded research topic. Undergraduates in VIP teams earn academic credit for their participation.",
