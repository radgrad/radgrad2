This doesn't mean you need to go right back to school after you graduate; many if not most graduate students in computer science spent at least a few years working before returning to school. But obtaining an M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science at some point can open up many new opportunities in your professional career. \n\nThe basic difference between an M.S. and Ph.D. degree is \"scientific contribution\".  An M.S. degree enables you to obtain more advanced skills in any of the CS disciplines.  M.S. programs are typically two years long.  A Ph.D. degree adds the requirement that you develop a dissertation that documents a scientific contribution: some entirely new knowledge about computer science. The Ph.D. degree typically requires at least two to four additional years after the M.S. degree.  \n\nTo prepare to include graduate school at some point after you graduate, the most important thing to do is to plan one or more academicTerms where you participate in a research project with a professor.  You can do this via [ICS 499](/explorer/courses/ics_499), or even on a volunteer basis as long as you devote sufficient time to the project. This is important for two reasons. First, successful participation demonstrates to the people who later review your graduate school application that you are able to do graduate-level work, which is usually more independent and research-related.  Second, it enables your professor to get to know you on a more personal level and in the context of an independent project, not just a few homework assignments.  This will enable your professor to write you a strong recommendation letter, which is crucial to getting accepted to graduate school.

Research scientists have the highest level of autonomy of any career goal; you are hired by an organization with the expectation that you will define and organize your work yourself (while within the general business or academic constraints of the organization).  Research scientists can often wear jeans and a t-shirt to work, because you will be evaluated almost totally on your ability to innovate. \n\nTo prepare to become a research scientist, you should also have [graduate school](/explorer/career-goals/graduate-school) as a career goal, and you should plan to (eventually) get a Ph.D. That said, you don't have to go to graduate school immediately: you might decide after graduation to first join or create a startup company based upon an idea you had as an undergraduate.  Successful research scientists have a tolerance for risk: not all research ideas are successful (if you can guarantee in advance that an idea will be successful, then by definition it no longer involves research).\n\nIf this career goal appeals to you, get involved with one (or more) research projects as an undergraduate.  This will both give you a taste for the work and enable you to develop connections with professors that will help when you eventually apply to graduate school.  If possible, try to publish a paper while you are an undergraduate. Your professor can help you to make that happen.

When students pick an opportunity, they associate it with a specific academic term (Fall, Spring, or Summer).  \n\nFor faculty, the most important reason to create opportunities is because it provides a mechanism for you to advertise your research projects to students.  Advertising your research projects as opportunities has the following advantages to you:\n\n1. By specifying one or more \"interests\" (i.e. disciplinary areas) associated with your research project, RadGrad can recommend your project to students who have also specified those interest areas.   \n\n2.  Because students earn ICE points for completing opportunities, and because we recommend you award the maximum number of Innovation points for participating in a research project for each academic term, students who wish to achieve the higher levels in RadGrad will almost certainly need to participate in a faculty research project.\n\n3. Students can pick your research project for multiple academic terms and earn Innovation points for each academic term.\n\n4. If you want to, you can offer the student the ability to enroll in an independent study course with you in addition to this opportunity.  That gives the student the ability to earn both Innovation and Competency points for the same work.\n\nTaken together, these advantages increase the odds that you will connect with qualified, motivated students when you specify one or more of your research projects as opportunities.\n\nStudents do not automatically earn points just for adding one of your opportunities to their degree plan. In order to get the points, they must ask you to \"verify\" their participation.  If you do not feel they participated enough to warrant the points at the end of an academic term, you do not have to verify their participation.\n\nUnless your project entails regular contact and interaction with industry professionals, your opportunity should not provide any Experience points. \n\nYou can review the existing opportunities listed below to see how points are currently awarded so that you can define your opportunity consistently.",

Departments can change the requirements once a year, and so academic plans have a year associated with them that indicates the year that they became the default requirements for their associated degree program.\n\nOnce students declare our major, they can choose the current academic plan associated with a degree program, or any future update to the academic plan.  For example, say a student wants to get a B.S. in Computer Science, and they declare our major in 2016.  Then, they can choose the B.S. in Computer Science academic plan from 2015 (since that was the one currently in effect when they declared their major).  They can also choose any future updated version of the academic plan, such as the B.S. in Computer Science from 2017.\n\nThis page lists all of the currently defined academic plans.

          "text": "Many students think that the only important measure of academic success is their GPA. Sadly, whether you're hoping to go to graduate school or just get an interesting, high paying job after graduation, a good GPA is no longer enough for you to stand out from the crowd.\n\nIn today's competitive market, employers and graduate schools are looking for evidence that you are *competent* with essential skills, that you can create *innovative* solutions to problems, and that you have some *experience* with the professional world outside of the university setting.\n\nRadGrad provides ICE as a way for you to measure your progress toward a truly well-rounded education that goes beyond the GPA. For each course and opportunity you participate in, you gain a certain number of ICE points.  Your goal, should you decide to accept it, is to achieve 100 points in all three categories by the time you graduate. \n\nSo just exactly how do you obtain these points?\n\n**INNOVATION**: You earn innovation points by completing opportunities that involve \"innovation\", such as research projects, hackathons, or other activities producing new insights or technologies. \n\n**COMPETENCY**: You earn competency points by completing classes.  The number of competency points depends upon your grade: you get 10 points for any kind of A, 6 points for any kind of B, and no points for a C or below. \n\n**EXPERIENCE**: You earn experience points by completing opportunities that provide \"real world experience\", such as internships or business plan competitions.\n\n#### The ICE Circle, explained\n\n<img style=\"padding-left: 10px\" class=\"ui small left floated image\" src=\"/images/help/ice-circle.png\">\n\nYour current ICE status is displayed graphically with a circle that appears in your navigation bar at the top of each RadGrad page, and also in annotated form on this page.   The circle indicates several things:\n\nFirst, your current number of *verified* points for this ICE measure. This appears as a number in the center of the circle.  It is also represented by the darkly colored portion of the circle. In this example, the student has 5 verified Innovation points, which appears as a number in the center of the circle and with 5% of the circle colored with a dark green line.\n\nSecond, your current number of *unverified* points for this ICE measure.  This appears as the lightly colored portion of the circle. In this example, the student has 90 unverified innovation points, which typically indicates the points she will receive for opportunities she has planned to participate at some future date in her degree program. So, 90% of the circle is colored with a light green line.\n\nThird, whether or not you have planned enough courses or opportunities to achieve 100 points for this ICE measure.  If any portion of the circle is light grey, that indicates that you have not yet planned enough courses or opportunities. In this example, the student has only added enough opportunities to her degree plan to achieve 95 Innovation points. So, 5% of the circle is colored with a light grey line.\n\n#### VERIFICATION\n\nThe RadGrad ICE score would not be meaningful if the points do not accurately represent the actual degree program experience. Therefore, all ICE points must be verified in order to count.  Otherwise, someone could get competency points for courses they didn't take, or experience points for internships they didn't actually do.\n\nTo verify your coursework, visit an ICS advisor after each academic term to ask them to upload your current STAR data to RadGrad.  You will receive verified competency points for each course in your STAR data that appears in RadGrad. \n\nOpportunities are verified in many different ways. Each opportunity description lists the mechanism for verification. For example, for some opportunities it may be as simple as taking a selfie with the organizer and then showing that picture to an ICS advisor or faculty member.",

This question will be reviewed by RadGrad administrators, potentially edited for clarity, and then released for all the mentors to answer. This approach is the best way to interact with mentors because you can get a variety of perspectives from different fields and different geographic areas. \n\nA second way is to email a single mentor directly.  Please do this only if you have a very specific question of the mentor: perhaps you are interested in applying for a job at the mentor's company.  If you contact a mentor directly, please be sure to have your professional portfolio up to date and ready for them to review so that they can learn more about your background in order to provide a high quality answer.

But rather than the traditional around-the-clock development over a single day or weekend, HACC will offer an extended period for development over one month.\n\nThe kickoff event will include team formation, foundational training, and workshops. In addition, participants will select from a list of challenges themed around key problems facing the state, and then work over the next several weeks to develop their solutions. The expanded month-long timeframe is meant to encourage sustainable solutions that are appropriately matched with technologies and platforms in use or being considered by the state. \n\n[Learn more here.](http://hacc.hawaii.gov/)\n\n#### Verification criteria\nTake a selfie at this event and submit to this Opportunity's sponsor along with work products as evidence of your participation.",

Topics include circuitry, computer hardware and software, Minecraft ahupuaʻa, and modding. This year we’re also running a series of traveling workshops teaching javascript and xcode in different communities around Oʻahu and exposing more students to coding.\n\nWe target middle school kids because they’re at an age where they’re open and ready for learning coding basics, but we will eventually provide edtech opportunities throughout the course of education. The metaphor we use is the idea of a tech ʻauwai–a channel of tech knowledge that kids can flow along through school, interacting with and enriching their communities along the way.\n\n[Learn more here.](http://www.purplemaia.org/)\n\n#### Verification criteria\nAt the conclusion of the internship, request that this Opportunity's sponsor login to RadGrad to verify your participation.

It's not that the concepts are difficult to understand nor is the courseload that heavy, but I found myself having to put more time to review and understand everything.
