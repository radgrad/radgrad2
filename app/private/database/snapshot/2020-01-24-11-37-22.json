This doesn't mean you need to go right back to school after you graduate; many if not most graduate students in computer science spent at least a few years working before returning to school. But obtaining an M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science at some point can open up many new opportunities in your professional career. \n\nThe basic difference between an M.S. and Ph.D. degree is \"scientific contribution\".  An M.S. degree enables you to obtain more advanced skills in any of the CS disciplines.  M.S. programs are typically two years long.  A Ph.D. degree adds the requirement that you develop a dissertation that documents a scientific contribution: some entirely new knowledge about computer science. The Ph.D. degree typically requires at least two to four additional years after the M.S. degree.  \n\nTo prepare to include graduate school at some point after you graduate, the most important thing to do is to plan one or more academicTerms where you participate in a research project with a professor.  You can do this via [ICS 499](/explorer/courses/ics_499), or even on a volunteer basis as long as you devote sufficient time to the project. This is important for two reasons. First, successful participation demonstrates to the people who later review your graduate school application that you are able to do graduate-level work, which is usually more independent and research-related.  Second, it enables your professor to get to know you on a more personal level and in the context of an independent project, not just a few homework assignments.  This will enable your professor to write you a strong recommendation letter, which is crucial to getting accepted to graduate school.

Research scientists have the highest level of autonomy of any career goal; you are hired by an organization with the expectation that you will define and organize your work yourself (while within the general business or academic constraints of the organization).  Research scientists can often wear jeans and a t-shirt to work, because you will be evaluated almost totally on your ability to innovate. \n\nTo prepare to become a research scientist, you should also have [graduate school](/explorer/career-goals/graduate-school) as a career goal, and you should plan to (eventually) get a Ph.D. That said, you don't have to go to graduate school immediately: you might decide after graduation to first join or create a startup company based upon an idea you had as an undergraduate.  Successful research scientists have a tolerance for risk: not all research ideas are successful (if you can guarantee in advance that an idea will be successful, then by definition it no longer involves research).\n\nIf this career goal appeals to you, get involved with one (or more) research projects as an undergraduate.  This will both give you a taste for the work and enable you to develop connections with professors that will help when you eventually apply to graduate school.

By specifying one or more \"interests\" (i.e. disciplinary areas) associated with your research project, RadGrad can recommend your project to students who have also specified those interest areas.   \n\n2.  Because students earn ICE points for completing opportunities, and because we recommend you award the maximum number of Innovation points for participating in a research project for each academic term, students who wish to achieve the higher levels in RadGrad will almost certainly need to participate in a faculty research project.\n\n3. Students can pick your research project for multiple academic terms and earn Innovation points for each academic term.\n\n4.

If you do not feel they participated enough to warrant the points at the end of an academic term, you do not have to verify their participation.\n\nUnless your project entails regular contact and interaction with industry professionals, your opportunity should not provide any Experience points. \n\nYou can review the existing opportunities listed below to see how points are currently awarded so that you can define your opportunity consistently.",

For example, \"B.A. in Computer Science\" or \"B.S. in Computer Sciences/Security Sciences\" are degree programs.\n\n* An \"academic plan\" is the set of departmental course requirements that must be fulfilled in order to complete a degree program.  Departments can change the requirements once a year, and so academic plans have a year associated with them that indicates the year that they became the default requirements for their associated degree program.\n\nOnce students declare our major, they can choose the current academic plan associated with a degree program, or any future update to the academic plan.  For example, say a student wants to get a B.S. in Computer Science, and they declare our major in 2016.  Then, they can choose the B.S. in Computer Science academic plan from 2015 (since that was the one currently in effect when they declared their major).  They can also choose any future updated version of the academic plan, such as the B.S. in Computer Science from 2017.\n\nThis page lists all of the currently defined academic plans.

For example, \"B.A. in Computer Science\" or \"B.S. in Computer Sciences/Security Sciences\" are degree programs.\n\n* An \"academic plan\" is the set of departmental course requirements that must be fulfilled in order to complete a degree program. Departments can change the requirements once a year, and so academic plans have a year associated with them that indicates the year that they became the default requirements for their associated degree program.\n\nOnce students declare our major, they can choose the current academic plan associated with a degree program, or any future update to the academic plan. For example, say a student wants to get a B.S. in Computer Science, and they declare our major in 2016. Then, they can choose the B.S. in Computer Science academic plan from 2015 (since that was the one currently in effect when they declared their major). They can also choose any future updated version of the academic plan, such as the B.S. in Computer Science from 2017.\n\nThis page lists all of the currently defined academic plans.

When students pick an opportunity, they associate it with a specific academic term.\n\nFor mentors, opportunities provide a mechanism for you to advertise internships in your company to students for Fall, Spring, or Summer. Advertising your internships as opportunities has the following advantages to you:\n\n1. By specifying one or more \"interests\" (i.e. disciplinary areas) associated with your internship opportunity, RadGrad can recommend your project to students who have also specified those interest areas.\n\n2. Because students gain ICE points for completing opportunities, and because we recommend you award the maximum number of Experience points (25) for participating in a full-time summer internship, students who wish to achieve the higher levels in RadGrad will almost certainly need to participate in an internship for at least one academic term.\n\n3. Students can pick your internship for multiple academic terms and gain opportunity points for each academic term.\n\n4. Finally, you might be able to arrange for the student to enroll in an independent study course with a faculty member in addition to this opportunity. That gives the student the ability to \"double dip\", and gain both Innovation and Experience points for the same work.\n\nThis page shows currently defined opportunities, but does not allow you to define a new one.

Most people have their first exposure to Jupyter Notebook by way of a data visualization, a shared notebook that includes a rendering of some data set as a graphic. Jupyter Notebook lets you author visualizations, but also share them and allow interactive changes to the shared code and data set.\n\n  * Code sharing. Cloud services like GitHub and Pastebin provide ways to share code, but they’re largely non-interactive. With a Jupyter Notebook, you can view code, execute it, and display the results directly in your web browser.\n\n  * Live interactions with code. Jupyter Notebook code isn’t static; it can be edited and re-run incrementally in real time, with feedback provided directly in the browser. Notebooks can also embed user controls (e.g., sliders or text input fields) that can be used as input sources for code.\n\n  * Documenting code samples. If you have a piece of code and you want to explain line-by-line how it works, with live feedback all along the way, you could embed it in a Jupyter Notebook. Best of all, the code will remain fully functional—you can add interactivity along with the explanation, showing and telling at the same time.\n\nFor more information, see [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)",

The goal is to run processors at high power levels  (to compute fast), but one is limited by temperature constraints (so as not to melt the chips).  In this context a key question is that of how to arrange the chips so as to maximize heat dissipation. It has been proposed to move to 3-D layouts, but it is not really clear which 3-D layouts are best. The objective of this project is to explore the 3-D design space and to design heuristics and meta-heuristics that compute good (i.e., high aggregate power and temperature under 80 Celsius) layouts. \n\nWe are looking for students interested in exploring heuristics and/or meta-heuristics design for the above problem and in developing them in Python (using the scipy.optimize package as a building block).  \n\nFamiliarity with Python is big plus, knowledge of meta-heuristics (gradient descent, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, etc.) is desirable but not necessary and would be part of the learning experience.",

Besides contributing much-needed civic applications to the public, the AGathon also brings together people from all aspects of the community. Because the vast majority of civic apps are meant to inform and guide the public, the State of Hawaii, Hawaii Technology Development Corp., Department of Ag and lead partner Hawaii Open Data believe that it’s important to involve the public in the development process to ensure that these applications have a broad public appeal.

Topics include circuitry, computer hardware and software, Minecraft ahupuaʻa, and modding. This year we’re also running a series of traveling workshops teaching javascript and xcode in different communities around Oʻahu and exposing more students to coding.\n\nWe target middle school kids because they’re at an age where they’re open and ready for learning coding basics, but we will eventually provide edtech opportunities throughout the course of education.

It's not that the concepts are difficult to understand nor is the courseload that heavy, but I found myself having to put more time to review and understand everything. The class structure for this was inverted, so we watched video lectures in our own time and used class time to do actual problems. I thought it was a better use of class time.",
