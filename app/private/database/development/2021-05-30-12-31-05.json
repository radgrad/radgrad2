This doesn't mean you need to go right back to school after you graduate; many if not most graduate students in computer science spent at least a few years working before returning to school. But obtaining an M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science at some point can open up many new opportunities in your professional career. \n\nThe basic difference between an M.S. and Ph.D. degree is \"scientific contribution\".  An M.S. degree enables you to obtain more advanced skills in any of the CS disciplines.  M.S. programs are typically two years long.  A Ph.D. degree adds the requirement that you develop a dissertation that documents a scientific contribution: some entirely new knowledge about computer science. The Ph.D. degree typically requires at least two to four additional years after the M.S. degree.  \n\nTo prepare to include graduate school at some point after you graduate, the most important thing to do is to plan one or more semesters where you participate in a research project with a professor.  You can do this via [ICS 499](/explorer/courses/ics_499), or even on a volunteer basis as long as you devote sufficient time to the project. This is important for two reasons. First, successful participation demonstrates to the people who later review your graduate school application that you are able to do graduate-level work, which is usually more independent and research-related.  Second, it enables your professor to get to know you on a more personal level and in the context of an independent project, not just a few homework assignments.  This will enable your professor to write you a strong recommendation letter, which is crucial to getting accepted to graduate school. \n\nFor more information, you might want to read [\"So you want to apply to grad school?\"](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/so-you-want-to-apply-to-/explorer/career-goals/graduate-school/)",

The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.

Notebooks can also embed user controls (e.g., sliders or text input fields) that can be used as input sources for code.\n\n  * Documenting code samples.

Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. \n\nLarge-scale quantum computers would theoretically be able to solve certain problems much more quickly than any classical computers that use even the best currently known algorithms, like integer factorization using Shor's algorithm (which is a quantum algorithm) and the simulation of quantum many-body systems. There exist quantum algorithms, such as Simon's algorithm, that run faster than any possible probabilistic classical algorithm.\n\nFor more information on Quantum Computing, you can start with the [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing).

More work needs to be done on both, but especially the Android app must be brought up to date and given more complete functionality.\n\nA portable peer-to-peer library: AllNet is designed to work both with the regular network infrastructure -- wired, cellular, and WiFi links -- and without it, using peer-to-peer (p2p) communications.  Some of the p2p has been implemented, specifically wifi ad-hoc mode between Linux systems and multipeer connectivity between apple system.

Knowledge of CUDA is a plus, but is NOT a prerequisite to start working on this project.\n\nRelevant courses: ICS 311, ICS 432, ICS 443, ICS 621, ICS 643, ICS 691C.\n\nThis project is sponsored by the [AlgoPARC](http://algoparc.ics.hawaii.edu/) research group, and there is REU funding so there is the possibility of being paid for your work. \n\n#### Verification criteria\n\nFor verification, please contact [Professor Nodari Sitchinava](http://algoparc.ics.hawaii.edu/nodari/index.html) after the semester is over.",

          "description": "The issue of power consumption of compute resources, and in particular CPUs, is  crucial for sustainability. And yes, many  scientific applications  need to perform large amounts of  computation as quickly  as possible. A well-known challenge is thus of orchestrate  application executions and to configure hardware platforms in a way that  strikes good compromises between achieved performance and energy  consumption.  \n\nOne particularly important class of scientific  applications are scientific workflows, which consist of large numbers of computational  tasks with inter-task dependencies. Several  algorithms  have been developed  to  make the execution of these  applications  \"energy-aware\". These  algorithms make their decisions based on models of the  energy consumption of workflow tasks. The  models  traditionally used have often naive and inaccurate.  Prof. Casanova and his collaborators have recently proposed a new model that has been shown to be more accurate ([see this ICCS'19 paper](https://henricasanova.github.io/files/papers/da_silva_iccs2019.pdf)). The next step is to quantify to  (beneficial) impact of using this model when executing workflow applications.\n\n#### Virtual Internship (unpaid, ICS 499)\n\nThis is a research internship in which one learns about the key concepts under high-performance computing, implements known algorithms as part of an existing  (but to be extended)  simulator written in C++, run simulation experiments, and draws conclusions. The intention  is to work in close collaboration  with professors and graduate students already working in this area. This internship would be well-balanced in terms of information finding, software development, and experimental analysis.  A research paper should  come out of it, on which the intern would be an author (and likely a first authorsif the internship is successful).\n\nApply by e-mailing Prof. Casanova at henric@hawaii.edu mentioning \"Research internship\"",

After deployment, use, and evaluation of RadGrad during year one, we discovered that our current support for internships does not meet the needs of students, but could be augmented to provide a more scalable and efficient solution.\n\nFor this project, we will augment RadGrad to provide support for the internship search process with several components. The first component is a crawler, which will visit online internship sites, parse internship listings to extract key details such as application deadline, interest areas, and application requirements, and store these results. The second component is a forms-based interface, which enables one-off entry of internships, such as those associated with local companies. The third component is a ``recommendation engine'', which can query the aggregated internship database using RadGrad data about a student and return relevant internship opportunities. The final component is the user interface, which enables students to see the internship profile extracted from their RadGrad data, modify and correct it as necessary, and then request that the engine send them notifications of relevant internships as they become available.\n\nFor more details, see the [InternBit Project Description Page](https://www.radgrad.org/docs/internship-internbit.html).\n\n#### Virtual Internship\n\nIf you are interested in this internship, please contact Philip Johnson (johnson@hawaii.edu), and include a link to your professional portfolio.",

In Dec. 2016, we are awarded a 5-year Scholarship for Service (SFS) grant from 2017 to 2022, which will support about 6 SFS scholars per year to study cyber security.\n\nEach student on a scholarship must be enrolled full time at UHM to receive the NSF support. A scholarship provides \n\n  * a stipend of $22,500 per academic year for an undergraduate student  or $34,000 per academic year for a graduate student; \n\n  * other expenses normally incurred by full-time students at UHM, including tuition and education related fees (does not include items such as meal plans, housing, or parking); \n\n  * a reimbursement allowance for health insurance up to $3,000 per year for using UH health insurance. (It may not be used for health insurance under parents or private insurance); \n\n  * a professional development allowance of up to $4,000 per year, including the annual SFS Job Fair at DC and other training or professional development travels related to cybersecurity studies;\n\n  * a book allowance up to $2,000 per academic year.\n\nA service obligation to the US Government (federal, state, city, or tribe) is required following graduation: One year of service in a cyber-security related government position is required for each scholarship year received. Also, a student on scholarship is expected to serve as a paid internship in a government cybersecurity related position during the first summer semester. A student is required to participate in a government “job fair” in early January in Washington DC. \n\nEach scholarship is awarded for up to three years, depending on the time for a student to complete her/his study at UHM. \n\nFor more information, see the [UHM CyberCorps SFS Home Page](https://sites.google.com/a/hawaii.edu/uhm-sfs/home).",

          "description": "The [WRENCH project](https://wrench-project.org/) is  an open-source C++ framework to aid in the development of simulators of distributed computing systems. Version 1.6 of the software is planned to be released in early  May 2020. WRENCH developers employ standard software engineering practices and tools (github, continuous integration with Travis and Docker, testing with Google Test, code coverage with Codecov, code quality measures with  Codacy, and many more).  \n\nThis project, although  not very  large yet (10,000 lines of C++ code) is relatively complex. Because of the typical drive-to-publish-result constraint, although the code is reasonably well-implemented  (and very well documents), it could be vastly improved in terms of code re-use, modularity, C++-ness, templating, development of examples, high-level documentation, code coverage, etc.  Because this is a research project (funded by the NSF), the project participants are constantly pushing the research agenda and cannot invest too much time in the software itself (they still do  too much of it, which is why the code is as good as it is, but not enough). \n\n#### Virtual Internship (Potentially paid, ICS 499)\n\nThis is a pure development internship in which the intern would come in as a \"C++ ninja\" and would make series of suggestions, improvements, and contributions to the source code. An applicant that already has great C++ chops would be ideal, but a motivated applicant that would see this as an opportunity to gain great C++ chops will of course be considered. It is also expected that the intern would learn about WRENCH and what it is used for, contribute to ongoing WRENCH development efforts, and also contribute to various projects that are currently developing extensions to WRENCH and/or simulators that use WRENCH.\n\nApply by e-mailing Prof. Casanova at henric@hawaii.edu mentioning \"Development internship\"",

          "comments": "The course was very fun in learning how to do the projects we did in ICS 111. The projects weren't hard for beginner programmers and were interesting to get them to have more fun with programming. The only downside was that the class didn't fully prepare you for ICS 211 where the fun little projects became assignments focused on the next stage of programming. There isn't much new students can do in terms of preparing for ICS 211 from ICS 111 since it is based on what you learn, but the things that you do learn may prove useful.",

          "comments": "The main thing one can learn from this course is Server Query Language or SQL. This is a great language to learn since it is the most common programming language used to manipulate or manage a database.  Knowing SQL can be a useful skill since it is sought after by employers in positions and fields that are not strictly ICS related.  For example, any business that uses a database to function requires it, including retailers, hospitals, banks, et cetera. With that said, I highly recommend taking this course to learn this invaluable language. One nice thing about taking this course is that the professor records his in-class lectures.  Bear in mind that the purpose of this is not to encourage students to get lazy and not attend his class.  I would not recommend this since there are times when his recordings do not cover solutions that he explains exclusively to those who attend his class.  Instead, the advantage of having these recordings available will allow one to rewatch the lecture in case he or she gets stuck and has a \\\"How do I do this again?\\\" moment.",

The assignments are very interesting because you get to mess around with a program that allows you to make and manipulate a virtual circuit. The downside is unless you plan on working with low level language code, the material you learn in this class may be irrelevant to what you will do in the future. That being said, I did enjoy the class and the assignments, and I advise that you should take the time to learn about binary and hex coding anyway.",

Being at eWorldES exposed me to a couple programs I have never worked with before (Vue, SpringBoot, mySQL) and it honestly was a fun experience building something for a real client. I got to work on both FE and BE issues and I enjoy the team I was placed on.\\n\\nOutside of actual programming, I learned so many things about agile software development and got to work with JIRA, Bitbucket, and SourceTree. I learned how sprints were organized and the QA process. The project I worked on had 10+ developers (both present and old) so it solidified good coding practices and showed the importance of good PR reviews.\\n\\nMy experience was all remote due to covid but it was still amazing. I definitely recommend interning here.",

As others have mentioned, this hackathon differs in the way that it offers participants an entire month to flesh out their ideas and develop their apps, so judges really do expect a lot more and have higher standards when evaluating our final submissions. I would recommend everyone to participate in this challenge to get the feel of competing in a hackathon without the pressure to finish in only a few days. It’s also a great opportunity to go outside of your comfort zone to find the best solution for your challenge, even if it’s not a language or framework that you’re intimately familiar with. My favorite part of this event is seeing all the amazing apps that teams have developed at the end of the month. It’s extremely inspiring and motivating to see everyone’s finished product and encourages me to start my own side projects.",
