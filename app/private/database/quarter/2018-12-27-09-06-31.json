          "description": "Let's be frank: if you are considering a long-term career in computer science, then graduate school should one of your career goals.  This doesn't mean you need to go right back to school after you graduate; many if not most graduate students in computer science spent at least a few years working before returning to school. But obtaining an M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science at some point can open up many new opportunities in your professional career. \n\nThe basic difference between an M.S. and Ph.D. degree is \"scientific contribution\".  An M.S. degree enables you to obtain more advanced skills in any of the CS disciplines.  M.S. programs are typically two years long.  A Ph.D. degree adds the requirement that you develop a dissertation that documents a scientific contribution: some entirely new knowledge about computer science. The Ph.D. degree typically requires at least two to four additional years after the M.S. degree.  \n\nTo prepare to include graduate school at some point after you graduate, the most important thing to do is to plan one or more academicTerms where you participate in a research project with a professor.  You can do this via [ICS 499](/explorer/courses/ics_499), or even on a volunteer basis as long as you devote sufficient time to the project. This is important for two reasons. First, successful participation demonstrates to the people who later review your graduate school application that you are able to do graduate-level work, which is usually more independent and research-related.  Second, it enables your professor to get to know you on a more personal level and in the context of an independent project, not just a few homework assignments.  This will enable your professor to write you a strong recommendation letter, which is crucial to getting accepted to graduate school.

If you are serious about it, then the best preparation is to first obtain a [B.S. in Computer Science](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/undergraduate-degree-programs/bs-ics/) or [B.S. in Computer Engineering](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/undergraduate-degree-programs/bs-ce/), and follow that with a Masters degree in Business Administration.  You do not have to go directly to graduate school: you can obtain your undergraduate degree, work for a few years, and then obtain your MBA.

Research scientists have the highest level of autonomy of any career goal; you are hired by an organization with the expectation that you will define and organize your work yourself (while within the general business or academic constraints of the organization).  Research scientists can often wear jeans and a t-shirt to work, because you will be evaluated almost totally on your ability to innovate. \n\nTo prepare to become a research scientist, you should also have [graduate school](/explorer/career-goals/graduate-school) as a career goal, and you should plan to (eventually) get a Ph.D. That said, you don't have to go to graduate school immediately: you might decide after graduation to first join or create a startup company based upon an idea you had as an undergraduate.  Successful research scientists have a tolerance for risk: not all research ideas are successful (if you can guarantee in advance that an idea will be successful, then by definition it no longer involves research).\n\nIf this career goal appeals to you, get involved with one (or more) research projects as an undergraduate.  This will both give you a taste for the work and enable you to develop connections with professors that will help when you eventually apply to graduate school.  If possible, try to publish a paper while you are an undergraduate. Your professor can help you to make that happen.

More specifically, an algorithm is an effective method that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.

VR has been defined as \"...a realistic and immersive simulation of a three-dimensional environment, created using interactive software and hardware, and experienced or controlled by movement of the body\" or as an \"immersive, interactive experience generated by a computer\".

While other exercises examine the abilities of a group of students to design, configure, and protect a network over the course of an entire academicTerm, this competition is focused on the more operational task of assuming administrative and protective duties for an existing commercial network. Teams are assessed based on their ability to detect and respond to outside threats, maintain availability of existing services such as mail servers and web servers, respond to business requests such as the addition or removal of additional services, and balance security needs against business needs. \n\n[Learn more here.](http://www.nationalccdc.org/index.php/competition/competitors/ccdc-regionals)\n\n#### Verification criteria\nAt the conclusion of the event, request this Opportunity's sponsor to login to RadGrad to verify your participation.

In addition, participants will select from a list of challenges themed around key problems facing the state, and then work over the next several weeks to develop their solutions. The expanded month-long timeframe is meant to encourage sustainable solutions that are appropriately matched with technologies and platforms in use or being considered by the state. \n\n[Learn more here.](http://hacc.hawaii.gov/)\n\n#### Verification criteria\nTake a selfie at this event and submit to this Opportunity's sponsor along with work products as evidence of your participation.",

Purple Maiʻa’s mission is to build channels of technological knowledge together with the Hawaiʻi’s youth in order to help communities thrive.\n\nIn 2014-2015 we ran a pilot year of after-school technology classes at Jarrett Middle School in Pālolo, and in 2015-2016 our classes are continuing at Jarrett and expanding to Stevenson Middle School and Kamaile Academy. Topics include circuitry, computer hardware and software, Minecraft ahupuaʻa, and modding. This year we’re also running a series of traveling workshops teaching javascript and xcode in different communities around Oʻahu and exposing more students to coding.\n\nWe target middle school kids because they’re at an age where they’re open and ready for learning coding basics, but we will eventually provide edtech opportunities throughout the course of education. The metaphor we use is the idea of a tech ʻauwai–a channel of tech knowledge that kids can flow along through school, interacting with and enriching their communities along the way.\n\n[Learn more here.](http://www.purplemaia.org/)\n\n#### Verification criteria\nAt the conclusion of the internship, request that this Opportunity's sponsor login to RadGrad to verify your participation.

SARP participants will assist in the operation of instruments onboard an aircraft to sample atmospheric chemicals, and/or to image land and water surfaces in multiple spectral bands.\n\nResearch areas include atmospheric chemistry, air quality, forest ecology, and ocean biology. Along with airborne data collection, students will participate in taking measurements at field sites.
