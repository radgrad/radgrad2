SARP participants will assist in the operation of instruments onboard an aircraft to sample atmospheric chemicals, and/or to image land and water surfaces in multiple spectral bands.\n\nResearch areas include atmospheric chemistry, air quality, forest ecology, and ocean biology. Along with airborne data collection, students will participate in taking measurements at field sites. The program culminates with formal presentations of research results and conclusions. \n\n[Learn more here.](https://earthscience.arc.nasa.gov/nsrc/sarp)\n\n#### Verification criteria\nAt the conclusion of the internship, request that this Opportunity's sponsor login to RadGrad to verify your participation.
