            <p>
              So, you&apos;re a faculty member in computer science, and already overbooked and overwhelmed. Why should you spend the time to learn yet another online tool? In a nutshell, we believe RadGrad offers the following benefits to
              you:
            </p>
            <List as="ul">
              <List.Item style={styles.li}>RadGrad helps you promote your research projects to motivated computer science students with compatible interests.</List.Item>
              <List.Item style={styles.li}>RadGrad incentivizes students to participate effectively in your research.</List.Item>
              <List.Item style={styles.li}>
                RadGrad allows you, along with other faculty, to collaboratively define and update disciplinary areas, career goals, and extra-curricular opportunities. This helps students stay abreast of the latest developments with only
                nominal effort on your part.
