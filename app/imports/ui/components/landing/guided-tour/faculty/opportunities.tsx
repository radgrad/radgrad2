            In RadGrad, opportunities are activities outside of regular coursework that enable students to
            earn &quot;Innovation&quot; and &quot;Experience&quot; points.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            For faculty, opportunities provide a mechanism for you to advertise your research projects to students.
            Using RadGrad has several benefits:
          </p>
          <List>
            <List.Item style={styles.li}>
              By associating one or more &quot;interests&quot; (i.e. disciplinary areas) with your research project,
              RadGrad can recommend your project to students who have also specified those interest areas.
            </List.Item>
            <List.Item style={styles.li}>
              Students gain ICE points for completing opportunities, and students who wish to achieve the higher levels
              in RadGrad will almost certainly need to participate in a faculty research project.
            </List.Item>
            <List.Item style={styles.li}>
              Students can pick your research project for multiple semesters and earn Innovation points for each
              semester.
            </List.Item>
          </List>
        </div>
