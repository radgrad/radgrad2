          <p style={styles.p}>One useful resource in RadGrad is the Explorer page, which enables you to learn about the
            latest computer science interest areas, courses, opportunities, academic plans, and even the other members
            of RadGrad.</p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Once you have specified one or more of RadGrad&apos;s
            <strong style={styles.strong}> {props.interests}</strong> interests, RadGrad can start to filter out
            opportunities that are unrelated to you. RadGrad can also make suggestions about courses and opportunities
            that you might not even know about.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>It doesn&apos;t end there! RadGrad is designed to build community, so each interest within
            the Explorer page displays students, faculty members, and alumni that have chosen them. Make connections and
            learn faster.</p>
          <p style={styles.p}>Of course, many students might only have a vague idea of the range of interests and career
            goals in computer science, and RadGrad provides an opportunity for the advisor to start this discussion and
            show them how RadGrad enables them to learn more about the field at their own pace.</p>
