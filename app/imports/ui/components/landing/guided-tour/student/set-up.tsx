            To start using RadGrad, an advisor or RadGrad admin must create an account for you. Then
            you can login using your regular UH credentials.

            If you are a new student with minimal knowledge about computer science, your advisor will
            give you a basic overview, then create your RadGrad account. You&apos;ll then work together to get a
            handle on your interests, career goals, and degree plan. If you have questions about any of those, RadGrad
            is designed to help you answer them.
          </p>

            Already well along in your degree program? No problem! Just meet with your advisor to
            create your account. RadGrad can help you identify areas to strengthen before you graduate.
