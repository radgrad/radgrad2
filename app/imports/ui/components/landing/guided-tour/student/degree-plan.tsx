            Now that you have picked a few interests and potential career goals, and discovered which courses and opportunities match, it&apos;s time to design your degree plan. The degree plan specifies which courses and opportunities
            you&apos;ll take each semester until you graduate. RadGrad is designed to help you graduate as quickly and efficiently as possible, with the best possible preparation for life after the diploma.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            In addition to recommending courses and opportunities, RadGrad also provides warnings when things don&apos;t look right. For example, RadGrad tells you when you add a course to a semester without having taken the prerequisite,
            or if your degree plan doesn&apos;t include all of the required courses.
          </p>

            In the current competitive job market, just getting a degree isn&apos;t enough to guarantee great job opportunities. RadGrad provides a new metric called <b>ICE</b> to help you develop the complete package of skills and
            experiences.
