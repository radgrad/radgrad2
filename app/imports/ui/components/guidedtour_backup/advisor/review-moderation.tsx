          For RadGrad to truly create a &quot;community&quot;, it must be possible for students to communicate back to
          the community both the strengths and the weaknesses of their degree experience. Two way communication both
          empowers students and makes RadGrad more valuable to them. To do this, RadGrad enables students to
          provide &quot;reviews&quot; of courses and opportunities.

          RadGrad reviews are different from end-of-semester course assessments in several ways. First, they are not
          anonymous: the student providing the review is identified and is thus accountable to the community for their
          opinion. Second, they are not private to the instructor of the course; anyone in the community can see them.
          Third, students do not have just a single moment in time to provide a review; they can provide an initial
          review upon completing the course or opportunity, and then revise it later if they realize upon reflection
          that they can provide a more insightful reaction. Finally, reviews are not just limited to courses, but can
          provide feedback about extracurricular opportunities as well.

          One of the activities for advisors in RadGrad is to provide &quot;gentle&quot; moderation of reviews. Indeed,
          RadGrad auto-publishes reviews as soon as a student writes them, in addition to placing them in a queue for
          moderation by an advisor. If an advisor believes a student&apos;s review is not in their best interest, then
          the advisor has the ability to retract the review and ask the student to edit it prior to republication. Our
          hope is that students will keep their reviews appropriate given that they are public and that their name is
          associated with them. Moderation will hopefully be needed only rarely if at all.
